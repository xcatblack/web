		<p>Setting up Apache Hive is relatively simple provided Hadoop is installed.</p>
		<p>We will unzip the source tarball into /opt/hive. All that is required next</p>
		<p>ensure that .bashrc is set properly (both of those steps are completed if </p>
		<p>the hadoop instructions were followed) and then initialize the database.</p>
		<pre>
			cd $HIVE_HOME
			schematool -dbType derby -initSchema			
		</pre>
		<p>And that's it! If schematool initialized correctly, Hive is up and running.</p>
		<p>There is, of course, much more advanced configuration that could be done.</p>
		<p>However, for the purposes of this tutorial, that is all we need.</p>
		<p>Hive can be connected to using beeline:</p>
		<pre>
			beeline -u jdbc:hive2://
		</pre>
